## How to play
There is a small story at the beginning of the game, then the user can control the otter's movements on the map with the up and down arrows. The J key is used for jumping and the T key is used for turning 90 degrees left.

Harry must run from the coyotes, and he can go in the water to evade them, as they are afraid to enter the water. If Harry is touched by a coyote the games ends.

The second coyote is very fast and he stands right in the area where there are logs to be gathered, so Harry must trap the coyote to collect those logs. To do this, he must quickly get the fish bait and lure the coyote into the temple, where it'll remain stuck and Harry can go on with his mission.

To gather the wood logs and fruits, he simply needs to touch them.

The game is won when all 20 wood logs are collected.
